# Projects

In this project, an analysis of Twitter users' sentiment towards the debate of who is the greatest football player of all time (GOAT) between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo was aimed to be conducted. The tweets with the #goatdebate hashtag were scraped using the snscrape Python library. The tweets were pre-processed by removing special characters and stopwords, using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) Python library. Then their sentiment scores were calculated using NLTK's VADER sentiment analysis tool, and positive, negative, and neutral sentiment scores were assigned to each tweet.
The data was visualized using Python libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib. A bar graph was created to display the count of tweets with positive, negative, and neutral sentiment scores. A histogram was plotted to compare the frequency distribution of the sentiment scores. Additionally, a box plot was created to compare the overall shape and spread of the distributions between the two players. Finally, a wordcloud was generated to show the most frequently occurring words.
The sentiment score analysis revealed that the majority of tweets were neutral in nature, while the remaining tweets were almost equally distributed between positive and negative sentiment.
This project provides insight into the sentiment of fans on Twitter towards Messi and Ronaldo in the context of the GOAT debate. However, further research using a larger and more diverse dataset would be required to draw more robust conclusions.
